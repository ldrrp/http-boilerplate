# Http example

Your assignment will be to createÂ **a key-value database service**. It should follow these guidelines:

- [x] It should be an HTTP server, running on port 4000 on your computer. It just needs to run locally, and doesn't need to follow any production-ready requirements (ie, you can have debug/development mode turned on).

### **Project spec**

We'd like you to implement the following basic features of a key-value database, running as an HTTP service.

- [x] For all endpoints:
    - [x] Each endpoint should accept JSON and return JSON.
    - [x] Each endpoint should respond with appropriate error codes: 200 for success, 4XX for user error, 5XX for server error.
- [x] For data storage:
    - [x] You should store data in memory
    - [x] Ideally using a well known data structure from your programming language's standard library.
- [x] A "Set" endpoint:
    - [x] It should use the POST HTTP method
    - [x] It should be available at the /set url path
    - [x] The request should contain a JSON POST body consisting of a JSON entry of the following form: {"key": "<some key>", "value": "<string value>" }.
    - [x] This endpoint should set the key value pair in memory.
    - [x] The keys and values should be strings only
    - [x] If successful, the response should be the JSON object that was just set.
- [x] A "Get" endpoint
    - [x] It should use the GET HTTP method
    - [x] It should be available at the /get url path
    - [x] The request should be of the form: /get?key=someKey, which should return the value stored in memory for "someKey".
    - [x] The response body should be a JSON object of the following form: {"key": "<some key>", "value": "<string value>" }.
    - [x] If called with no parameters, it should return an error.
- [x] A "Delete" endpoint
    - [x] It should use the POST HTTP method
    - [x] It should be available at the /delete url path
    - [x] The request should contain a JSON POST body consisting of a JSON entry of the following form: {"key": "<some key>"}.
    - [x] If the key was successfully deleted, the response should be a JSON document including the key that was deleted.
    - [x] If called with no parameters, should return an error.
    - [x] If the key doesn't exist, it should respond with a 200, but should contain a message saying the key didn't exist.
